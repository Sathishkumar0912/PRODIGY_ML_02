# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This repository contains a Python script that performs customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. The segmentation is based on two features: **Age** and **Annual Income (k$)**. The goal is to classify customers into distinct groups (clusters) that exhibit similar characteristics. This type of analysis can be useful for businesses to understand their customer base and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Files in this Repository

- `Mall_Customers.csv`: The dataset used for customer segmentation (you should upload this file to your repository).
- `customer_segmentation.py`: The Python script that performs the data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.
- `Mall_Customers_Clustered.csv`: The output file generated by the script, containing the original dataset with an additional "Cluster" column indicating the assigned cluster for each customer.

## Features of the Script

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Converts the `CustomerID` to integer.
  - Replaces numerical gender codes (0 for Female, 1 for Male) with actual gender labels.
  - Selects relevant features for clustering (`Age` and `Annual Income`).
  
- **K-Means Clustering**: 
  - Standardizes the features using `StandardScaler`.
  - Determines the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
  - Applies K-Means clustering with the chosen number of clusters (3 clusters by default).

- **Visualization**:
  - A scatter plot is generated to visualize the customer segments based on their age and annual income.

- **Output**:
  - A CSV file containing the original data with an additional `Cluster` column that indicates the cluster each customer belongs to.


## Output

The script will produce:
- A plot showing the customer segments.
- A CSV file (`Mall_Customers_Clustered.csv`) with the customer data, now including an additional column that indicates the cluster each customer belongs to.
